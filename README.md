# Health_spending_for_OECD_countries

This is a part of the Makeover Monday series in 2020.
The dataset contains data on the 37 OECD countries' health spending (total as well as the components that add up to the total), ranging from the years 1970 to 2019.
An exercise in visualization using PowerBI, this is helping me brush up my skills in this software/tool.
